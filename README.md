## Software Development Plan

### Statement of Purpose and Scope

Discover your Greek God is designed to match the users personality with a Greek God by answering various questions in the questionnaire. It is a easy to use terminal application, which will provide the personality match with users who are bored and need something to do. It is a fun distraction and was created for enjoyment purposes.

### Target Audience

The app is targeted for people who enjoy quizzes. As most quizzes are long and time consuming, Discover your Greek God is simple, fast and free to try. Users will need to have access to the command line, so it would be more suitable to Mac or Linux users.

## Features

Discover your Greek God includes three Greek Gods with distinct personalities. To learn abut the personality and type of God they were, users can select the first option, 'learn about the Greek Gods'.

### Questionnaire
